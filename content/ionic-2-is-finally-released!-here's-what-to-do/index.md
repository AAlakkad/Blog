The time has arrived when we stopped waiting for Ionic 2 to be release, and now it’s time to get our hands dirty!

Two hours ago Ionic team has announced that version 2 is officially released.

### What to do next?

1\. Read v2 [announcement](http://blog.ionic.io/announcing-ionic-2-0-0-final/)

2\. Check the [documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/)

3\. Get your hands dirty and create a new app right away! hint: `ionic start cutePuppyPics --v2`

4\. If you’re already familiar with Ionic 1, check out the differences introduced in v2 to be up to date in short time.

### Great new features in Ionic 2

Personally, one of the best new features is the theming.

In the past we all struggled with the default theme in version 1, it was good but wasn’t following the latest trends e.g. Material Design.

We had to create the required theme ourselves.

Another great thing is the performance; scrolling with 60 fps, reduced layout thrashing and repaints, and of course it’s built on top of Angular 2 which had moved Angular performance to a whole level.

You might come across a situation, where you want to switch to an application or open a new instance of it. You press (Command ⌘ + Tab) combination. and you don’t get your window, just the title in the menu bar!

You end up using the mouse to click again on the application icon in the dock.

Luckily there’s an _“awkward”_ shortcut to show the window of the app you want.

While using (Command ⌘ + Tab) to switch windows, press the Options/Alt ⌥ key right before releasing Command key.

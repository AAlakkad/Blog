What’s life?  
Is it being with your family? or maybe doing what you like sometimes?  
Probably anything might fit here, except being a workaholic.

I’ll not tell you that comfort life is the good life, we’re not here on earth to rest. also we’re not here to become wheel horse who don’t stop working!

My current day-to-day life schedule is:

-   8:00–8:30 AM: Wake up in the morning, and have a breakfast.
-   8:30–9:00 AM: Go to my job at the company.
-   5:30–6:00 PM: Come back home.
-   6:00–6:30 PM: have a launch.
-   6:30–7:30 PM: have some rest.
-   7:30–9:30 PM: learn something new about my work or do some side projects.
-   9:30–10:30 PM: wasting time.
-   Sleeping

Is that really life?

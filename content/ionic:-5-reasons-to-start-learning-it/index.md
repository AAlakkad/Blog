You already know about Ionic, it’s a JavaScript framework for building mobile apps.

Here are 5 reasons why Ionic is a good material to learn and use in 2017:

### 1\. Big companies support Ionic

Quote from Ionic blog post [announcement](http://blog.ionic.io/announcing-ionics-8-5m-series-a/):

> … total funding raised to $12.2M

Plus 22 companies as trusted partners.

### 2\. Using latest web technologies.

Ever heard of [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/)? what about ES6 or [Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/)?

If you know them, that’s great they all included inside Ionic 2. if not, you should have a quick look at these great technologies and titles.

### 3\. Easier to learn than other frameworks

With the huge amount of resources, it has never been that easy to learn the framework.

It’s not that there are a lot of resources, it’s also easier that other frameworks.

See the following [code snippet](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/components/#tabs) from Ionic to built tabs:

While the tabs in React Native… oops!

There are no tabs included by default in React Native, we need to use an external library!

The following is a [sample](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-tabs) of using tabs in that library:

While Ionic code is importing 2 files one for each tab, you can notice which one has more readability.

### 4\. Ease of use

Have you heard of a mobile developer, who spent a lot of time fixing small issues? like generating icons with different sizes to suit the wide range of devices!

In ionic we even think about it, we run a single command:

```
ionic resources
```

And all the icons are ready to be used on any device!

You liked how we generate icons didn’t you?

Besides tools efficiency, we have a wide range of components and themes to choose from. Ionic 2 has Material for Android, Metro for Windows phone and iOS style for iPhones and iPads.

All this is part of the huge amount of components ready!

### 5\. Cross-platform support

The good thing is, with Ionic you write your app one time, and it runs on Android, iOS, and even Windows Phone!

Do you want to learn Java, Swift, and C# to write your app? You write it in JavaScript and your app is ready to for publishing on the major mobile platforms.

Are you slouching in front of your computer right now?

### What is posture and why should you care ?

Posture refers to the way you hold your body while sitting or standing. Did you know that just sitting for long periods can cause numerous injuries and strain to your body? Did you know it can even lead to early death?

### Some consequences associated with sitting for too long

1.  You burn less calories because your metabolism slows down— leading to more **stored fat in your body**
2.  It increases your risk of **Diabetes** and **Heart Disease**
3.  It could result in **Chronic Pain** of the lower back, neck and shoulder — which could cause low quality sleep and insomnia
4.  Sitting for long periods and leading a sedentary life is linked to **Early Death**

Allah (SWT) said:

> _{وَلَا تُلْقُوا بِأَيْدِيكُمْ إِلَى التَّهْلُكَةِ}_

“and do not throw yourselves with your own hands into destruction” (Aya: 195 — Al-Baqara)

We care about our bodies, because it’s Amanah, and we have to take care of that Amanah.

### Tips to consider

If the most part of your day consists of sitting in front of a computer, or in meetings, your health may be suffering. There are things you can do to improve your health and decrease the risks associated with this problem.

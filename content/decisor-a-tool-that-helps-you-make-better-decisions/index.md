![Need help making a decision? 🤔](./asset-1.jpeg)

It all started when I wanted to buy a car, I kept looking for and comparing cars based on many aspects.

I’ve collected about 20 cars listing that could be “my first car”, but I got lost between the choices! I know that I will choose one of it now, then after a couple hours I’d change my mind and pick another one.

So I stopped comparing cars and started digging into how to make good decisions. To help me choose a car — in my case.

I stumbled upon a method for making decisions that depend on scores or some people call it weights. (I’ll call it score-based method).

### What’s score-based decision making?

The score-based method starts by adding the options you’re choosing from, then adding attributes for each option. in my case: gear, year, model, etc.

After that, you’ll give a score to each option’s attribute, so for the first car in the gear attribute I’d give it a score of 3. and for the second car in the gear attribute, I’d give it a score of 5, and so on.

After you fill scores for all the attributes, calculate the score for each option. Then you compare the final scores to pick the best option; depending on the attributes that matter.

### First attempt

I ended up making a big excel file that contains all the cars (the options) I collected as rows.  
Then added all attributes that every matter to each car, then filled the score for each attribute.  
Finally, I added another column for summing the score for each row (which represent an option — a car).

Then, I got my first car 🚗!

### Deciding on building Decisor

After getting the car (and going on many trips with it 💪), I decided that no one has to experience the suffering I went through. And what I learned through this journey must be capsuled into something that other people can use.

I started building Decisor, a tool inspired by the score-based decision-making method, I finished the beta version in 2 months. You can try it [here](https://decisor.netlify.com).

### What’s next for Decisor

The next steps for Decisor are to add user accounts so you can save many documents of decisions you have to make.

I’m planning on adding more features that will fit a paid plan apart from the free plan so I can give this project more time.

### Gratitudes

I have to thank a lot of people who helped me through building this project.  
The most helpful person that helped me and kept me motivated is [Zahara Cassim](https://medium.com/@cassim_13433), and the guys at [Product Hunt](https://medium.com/@producthunt) platform — who encouraged me frequently to build and ship!

I need your help on the project to enhance it and make it easier, please give it a try and send me your feedbacks!

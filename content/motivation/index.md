Do you understand the reasons behind your behaviors and why you act the way you do?

### Why it is important?

Motivation provides the drive for people to accomplish their goals, maintain their responsibilities or solve problems.

Motivated people generate higher value and lead to more substantial levels of achievement.

Do you ever notice how some people always manage to achieve more than others? Do you ever wonder how they stay motivated?

### Steps to get your motivation back

It’s easy to lose your motivation, but it’s also easy to get it back or just get things done.

Here are some of our tips:

-   Start. Just by starting anything, it’s easier to keep it moving.
-   Remind yourself by asking these questions, “What am I doing? Why I’m doing it? What’s my goal?”
-   Scheduling time for doing a specific task like writing that next article or even to talk to your parents.
-   Ignore your lack of motivation. Sometimes you don’t need motivation to do anything, you can ignore it entirely and just start doing what you have to do, motivation could get back slowly. Sometimes you just have to do what you have to do.
-   Habits. Make yourself a routine and stick to it. With the help of scheduling, it’ll be easier to get things done even without having to have to motivate yourself first.
-   Reduce clutter. Whether it’s too much news or unnecessary choices, eliminate as much as you can to keep your mind from being busy in things that are not important.

### What about times where you falter?

Sometimes, we fall off our routine or we have those days where we just are not in the right frame of mind. Bad days are just an ordinary part of life. Don’t be too hard on yourself.

The good thing is that the bad time will always pass.

Allah (SWT) said:

> “فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا”

> “So, verily, with every difficulty, there is relief”

> (Al-Sharh — Aya 5)

If you’re doing good, even if you feel discomfort, later you’ll be relieved.

When you are experiencing difficulty, you can’t pause your entire life and wait until it passes, this means you would have wasted that time without doing anything which will lead to less motivation and more depression. It’s a never ending cycle.

The good thing is when you stick to your good habits or your routine, even if you don’t feel like it, you’ll feel more grateful, more motivated and more powerful that you could do everything you put your mind to when it’s over.

Life’s like a rollercoaster, it goes up and down. Sometimes it spins you so hard you might want to throw up! It is never always up nor always down, and that is what makes you look forward to what is next.
